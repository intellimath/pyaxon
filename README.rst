PYAXON
======

``pyaxon`` is an `MIT Licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ python library
for `AXON <http://axon.intellimath.org>`_ -
An eXtended Object Notation - simple text based format for interchanging
objects, documents and data.
It tries to combine the best of `JSON <http://www.json.org>`_,
`XML <http://www.w3.org/XML/>`_ and `YAML <http://www.yaml.org>`_.

Main repository for ``pyaxon`` is on `bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/intellimath/pyaxon>`_.
There is a mirror on `github <https://github.com/intellimath/pyaxon>`_

Features
--------

1. Provide simple API for loading and dumping of objects in textual form.
2. Provide safe loading and dumping by default.
3. Provide unsafe loading and dumping of objects on the base of registration of factory/reduce callables.
4. Provide a way for fully controlled by application/framework/library unsafe loading and dumping.
5. It's sufficiently fast so as to be useful.

History
-------

**0.5.8**

1. Fix 2.7/3.3 compatibility error with reading from files.
2. Pretty dumping now is more compact in simple cases.
3. Now default pretty dumping mode is indented without braces (like YAML);
   new parameter ``braces=1`` with ``pretty=1`` specifies formatted mode with braces (like JSON).

**0.5.7**

1. Refine indentation control when loading complex objects in indented form.
2. Restore support of names as quoted strings a.k.a. ``'the name'``.
3. Make ``date/time/datetime`` creation code compatible with pure python mode.
4. Add ``hsize`` parameter in pretty dumping mode. It specifies maximum number of
   simple data items in the line.
5. Add more tests by examples.

**0.5.6**

1. Fix support for decimal ``Infinity`` and ``NaN``.
2. Fix support for ``base64`` in ``python2.7``.
3. Add support for complex names like ``a.b.c.d``.

**0.5.5**

1. Make creation of custom builders of atomic values easier too (in ``cython`` only).
2. Make creation of custom object builders easier (both in ``cython`` and ``python``).
   This allows you to implement custom import/export for data in ``XML`` and ``YAML``
   representation.
3. Add plotting of results to simple benchmark script.

**0.5.4**

1. Make internal timezone class (for ``python2.7``) compatible with datetime.timezone class (for ``python3.2`` and higher).
2. Make creation of custom object builders (both safe and unsafe) easier (in ``cython`` only).

**0.5.3**

1. Dumping is now faster.

**0.5.2**

1. Refactor setup.py so that .py sources of extensions dosn't installed.
2. Ensuire that attribute names and keys loads and dumps correctly.
3. Add explicit flag (``use_cython``) in order to decide when to use cython compiler.

**0.5.1**

1. Add notebook with performance comparisons with ``JSON`` and ``YAML``.
2. Refactor setup.py so that project could be installed with/without ``Cython`` installation.
3. Some improvements with introductory notebooks.
4. Make project uploadable to ``PyPI`` by ``setup.py``.



**0.5**

   First public release of ``pyaxon``.
